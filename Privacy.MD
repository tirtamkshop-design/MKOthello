MK Othello – Privacy Policy

Last updated: 29th Nov 2025

Welcome to MK Othello for Android, developed by mkshop.

Your privacy is very important to us. As an Android user myself, I understand how frustrating it can be when apps collect data without your knowledge. This privacy policy explains what information the MK Othello app does — and does not — collect.

1. Data Collected by the App

MK Othello does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

The app does not request or access any personal information.

All game data and settings remain locally on your device.

Clearing the app data or uninstalling the app removes all settings and game progress.

The app does not require an internet connection to function (except for downloading or updating the app via the Google Play Store).

2. Permissions

This app does not request or require any special permissions.
It only uses the basic permissions required for standard Android app functionality.

3. Google Play Store Analytics (Important Notice)

While the MK Othello app itself does not collect any data, please be aware that:

Google Play Store and the Android operating system may collect diagnostic, crash, or installation analytics automatically.

These analytics are controlled by Google, not by mkshop or the MK Othello app.

No analytics or tracking code is included in the MK Othello application.

For details on data Google may collect, please refer to the Google Play Privacy and Security documentation.

4. Contact
